# IoT Fire Detection and Alert System  
This Raspberry Piâ€“based IoT Fire Detection and Alert System was developed using Python and GPIO-connected hardware components. The system integrates a fire sensor, moisture sensor, buzzer, and LED to provide real-time environmental monitoring and automated alerts. When the fire sensor (connected to GPIO 21) detects a flame, the buzzer and LED are activated as immediate on-site warnings. Simultaneously, the system sends an emergency SMS notification using the ClickSend REST API, alerting users remotely. To simulate a fire suppression response, a moisture sensor monitors for the presence of water. When water is detected, the alarm system is automatically deactivated, signaling that the threat has been addressed. The project uses the gpiozero and RPi.GPIO libraries to interface with hardware components. To run the program, connect the sensors and output devices to the appropriate GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi, install dependencies with `pip install gpiozero RPi.GPIO`, configure your ClickSend API credentials inside the script, and run the system using `python3 fire_alert_system.py`.
